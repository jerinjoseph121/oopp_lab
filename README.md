### Joint Peer Project done by:
**Name:** Mingxing Wang\
**BU ID:** U81767669\
**Name:** Jerin Joseph\
**BU ID:** U11191999

## Main File Contents

1. **Src Folder**\
  This folder contains all the important .java files which are used to execute the program. It contains 4 folders at the moment.
    1. **common:** Used to store all the classes and interfaces which are used again for other games.
    2. **main:** Contains the GameApplication class which is used to run the application.
    3. **slidePuzzle:** Contains all the classes which are used specifically for the slidePuzzle game. It includes slidePuzzle, slidePuzzleBoard, Tile, Position and Direction class.
    4. **dotsAndBoxes:** Contains all the classes which are used for the dots and boxes game. It includes DotsAndBoxes and DotsAndBoxesBoard.
2. **READ_ME file**\
  Contains all the important information about the project
3. **Assignment_2_UML_Diagram image**\
  This is an image file which shows the current inheritance structure of all classes. It also shows how classes are divided based on their logic.\
For all classes, the data members and methods are only mentioned without the datatype and arguments. This is to avoid over cramming of details of a class.

## Run steps
- This entire project is an IntelliJ IDEA project, so download the project and run GameApplication.java file which is located in the main folder
- Note: Make sure java version 8 is being used since this project runs on that version.

## Scalability and Extendibility
- Created abstract classes like Board and Game which will be extended to the classes used in different games.
- Created separate classes for timer and score which are utilized in every game.
- Made sure that all the common repetitive methods are added in the common classes which could be utilized in other games in the future.
